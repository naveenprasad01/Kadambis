  <h3><a name="antispam"></a>Anti-spam policy</h3>
    <p>"Spam" refers electronic communications that are unsolicited and sent in bulk, usually for a commercial purpose.

Spam is an irritant to regular users and a significant problem for many organisations. Technical measures are the principal way of dealing with spam but they can be usefully supplemented by legal measures.

This template may be used to create a policy on spam suitable for publication on a website or online service.

        If you need an anti-spam policy for use in relation to email marketing services</p>
    
    <h3><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies policy</h3>
    <p>UK and EU law require that websites that use cookies (that is, most websites) provide information to users about those cookies.

This policy is intended to help you to provide that cookie information. The policy is a more detailed version of the basic cookies policy incorporated into our privacy policy template. Depending upon your circumstances, you may need to supplement the policy with consent procedures.

As a general rule, the fewer legal documents on a website, the better. With this in mind, you should also consider our combined privacy and cookies policy templates.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="copyright"></a>Copyright notice</h3>
    <p>This free copyright notice has been designed for inclusion on a website.

Copyright is the primary intellectual property right protecting websites, and the purpose of a website copyright notice is to communicate information about copyright to users.

This policy includes an assertion of copyright ownership. It also includes provisions concerning the licensing of website copyright, the infringement of website copyright materials and copyright notifications.

Other copyright-related documents you might be interested in are our licence of copyright and assignment of copyright templates</p>
    
    <h3><a name="Legal"></a>Legal disclaimer</h3>
    <p>This legal disclaimer may be suitable for use on websites that include legal information - for example, lawyers' websites or the websites of other legal service providers.

Issues covered in the disclaimer include the distinction between legal information and advice and the question of when to obtain assistance from a lawyer. As with all disclaimers of liability, the enforceability of the terms of the document may be open to question.

See also our general website disclaimer document.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="linking"></a>Linking policy</h3>
    <p>This is a template linking policy. It has been designed to help those website operators who wish to set out in detail their policies and practices on hyperlinking.

The policy may be used to state both a website's policy for linking out as well expectations in relation to incoming links. However, unless a linking policy forms part of an enforceable contract, the provisions in relation to incoming links at least are unlikely to be enforceable.

Although this sort of policy is unusual, it can still be useful on certain types of site.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="medical"></a>Medical disclaimer</h3>
    <p>This medical disclaimer may be suitable for use on websites that provide free medical information - such as the websites of healthcare providers.

This disclaimer may be used as a stand-alone document or as a part of general website terms and conditions.

This medical disclaimer is designed to help clarify the publisher's responsibilities and thereby reduce the legal risks associated with this kind of website.
